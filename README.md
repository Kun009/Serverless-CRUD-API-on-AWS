# Serverless-CRUD-API-on-AWS
This project implements a serverless CRUD API using AWS API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch. The API supports basic create, read, update, and delete operations. Postman was used to test the endpoints, and images of the operations are included in the repository.
